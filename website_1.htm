        <h3>Information on Birds</h3>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird" class="blockquote text-info">
          <p>Birds are a group of warm-blooded vertebrates constituting the class Aves,
          characterized by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs,
          a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet lightweight
          skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in) bee
          hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. There are about ten thousand living
          species, more than half of which are passerine, or "perching" birds. Birds have
          wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups without
          wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs,
          gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss
          of flight in some birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse endemic island
          species. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are also uniquely adapted
          for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds
          and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.</p>

        <h3>Information on Dogs</h3>
        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" class="blockquote text-info">
          <p>The dog (Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species or Canis lupus
          familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf) is a domesticated carnivore
          of the family Canidae. It is part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most
          widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are
          sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were
          first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct.
          The dog was the first species to be domesticated, and has been selectively bred
          over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats" class="blockquote text-info">
          <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
          It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often
          referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members
          of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral
          cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats
          are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents.
          About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>

          <p>The horse (Equus ferus caballus) is one of two extant subspecies of
          Equus ferus. It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic
          family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years
          from a small multi-toed creature, Eohippus, into the large, single-toed
          animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and
          their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC.
          Horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated
          populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations
          are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that
          have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse,
          a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is
          an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts,

          <p>Fish are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits.

            Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and
            cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups.
            The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied
            chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they
            lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be
            more agile than their invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to
            evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of
            forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected
            them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian
            period, after which many (such as sharks) became formidable marine predators
